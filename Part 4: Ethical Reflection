In my heart disease prediction project, I trained and deployed machine learning models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) 
to identify patients at risk of cardiovascular disease. While the technical workflow achieved strong accuracy (~88%), 
ensuring ethical AI principles in such a health-related project is equally critical.

The most challenging aspect was dealing with data bias and missing values. The dataset came from multiple sources (Cleveland, Hungary, 
Switzerland, VA Long Beach), but it may underrepresent some demographic groups, such as women or younger patients.
If the model learns from imbalanced data, it could make biased predictions—potentially underdiagnosing women, who often show different
symptoms of heart disease compared to men. 

This reinforced for me that fairness in data collection is just as important as model accuracy.
Another ethical consideration is patient privacy and autonomy. Health data is highly sensitive,
and even though my project used a public dataset, a real-world deployment must comply with regulations like HIPAA/GDPR.
Patients should give informed consent before their data is used, and they should have the right to understand how AI contributes 
to their diagnosis. 

This connects to transparency and explainability: a Random Forest might be accurate, but clinicians and patients
need understandable insights (e.g., “cholesterol and chest pain type were key factors in your risk prediction”).

If given more time and resources, I would improve my approach by:

Running fairness audits (e.g., checking if predictions differ across gender or race).

Using explainability tools such as SHAP or LIME to make predictions interpretable.

Collaborating with healthcare professionals to validate the system clinically before deployment.
While my project shows the potential of AI in supporting early detection of heart disease, responsible use requires bias mitigation,
privacy safeguards, and transparency, so that the model benefits all patients fairly and builds trust in AI-driven healthcare.
