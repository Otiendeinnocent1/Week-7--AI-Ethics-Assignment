Part 1: Theoretical Understanding 
Q1. Algorithmic Bias

Definition: Algorithmic bias occurs when AI systems produce unfair outcomes that systematically disadvantage certain groups due to flawed data, design, or assumptions.

Examples:

Hiring – An AI trained on historical male-dominated resumes penalizes female applicants.

Facial recognition – Higher error rates for darker-skinned individuals due to underrepresentation in training datasets.

Q2. Transparency vs Explainability

Transparency: The extent to which the design, data, and processes of an AI system are open and accessible. Example: Publishing datasets and model documentation.

Explainability: The ability to understand and communicate how the AI makes individual decisions. Example: Feature importance scores.

Importance: Transparency builds trust at a system level, while explainability ensures accountability at the decision level. Both are vital for ethical AI adoption.

Q3. GDPR & AI in the EU

GDPR enforces data protection, user consent, and the right to explanation.

Impacts on AI development:

Limits on automated decision-making without human oversight.

Mandatory data minimization and anonymization.

Stronger accountability for AI systems that process personal data.

Principles Matching

A) Justice → Fair distribution of AI benefits and risks.

B) Non-maleficence → Ensuring AI does not harm individuals or society.

C) Autonomy → Respecting users’ right to control their data and decisions.

D) Sustainability → Designing AI to be environmentally friendly.
